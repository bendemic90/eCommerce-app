# eCommerce-app
back-end routing for a Shop webapp with sequelize

## Features
* the ability to view all tables (tag, product, category) with assosciated (joined) data
* CRUD operations on all data

## Reasoning
Utilising sequelize to build and `CRUD` a database comprising of product information (tags, price, stock, etc).

## Challenges & Process
1. I have long found the syntax and interactions of `sequelize` quite difficult to navigate, and as such it took me a rather long time to properly construct the models and to manage their assosciations.
2. Initially I had some syntactic errors in my models which made working with the `CRUD` operations difficult, as I would get errors relating to foreign keys and being unable to remove a particular item for that reason.
