# eCommerce-app
back-end routing for a Shop webapp with sequelize

## Features
* the ability to view all tables (tag, product, category) with assosciated (joined) data
* CRUD operations on all data

## Reasoning
Utilising sequelize to build and `CRUD` a database comprising of product information (tags, price, stock, etc).

## Challenges & Process
1. I found the update employee function very difficult, I'm certain that my method (although it works) is very difficult to interpret and even more difficult for me to explain. In the end I ran out of time, and considering that I met the basic functionality requirements I decided to leave it there.
